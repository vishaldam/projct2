  <div class="entry-content"><p>This first week at Launch has been great. Between my fellow students and instructors, I&rsquo;ve met some very interesting people. As part of the weekly &ldquo;Systems Checks,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been tasked with the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>Write a blog article about something that changed your way of thinking this week. How is software development (or the Launch Academy experience) different from your other experiences?</p></blockquote>

<p>Firstly, Launch&rsquo;s focus on collaborative efforts towards knowledge and know-how (over book learning, which has its appropriate place in different arenas) can be very conducive to effective learning, especially when it comes to something like learning how to code in Ruby. The result of having others around you who you can ask questions of and be able to discuss coding problems with garners an outcome that is far more productive for me than simply trying to learn Ruby on my own.</p>

<p>The other leg to this table of learning is having an environment that allows me to focus just on one thing all day. When I trade options all day, my attention is divided between tens if not a hundred ideas. I can&rsquo;t guarantee that any one idea will work, so the more you have, the better your chances of good results. This method has its merits, but it doesn&rsquo;t allow for focus because of how many different trading ideas vied for my brain&rsquo;s attention. Being at Launch allows me to focus on one thing: How to code and how to learn how to code. I&rsquo;d like to bring some of what I learn here into trading options, but first, my focus is on the coding part.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Richard K. Morgan&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Altered-Carbon-Richard-Morgan-ebook/dp/B000FBFMZ2/">Altered Carbon</a> is a phenomenal romp through 25th century Earth that explores a future of rampant wealth inequality, religious oppression, and various concepts in philosophy of mind through future noir. The world Morgan constructed reminds me of a darker, more sinister version of the Bladerunner universe, however with colonized planets in far away star systems, each with their own social and cultural nuances that we get occasional glimpses of throughout the novel. This particular detective story, however, occurs on Earth where a person can upload and download his or her consciousness into a new &ldquo;sleeve,&rdquo; or body. The protagonist, Takeshi Kovacs, is an ex-military special forces officer turned criminal turned mercenary. His cortical stack, which contains his consciousness, is stored for a period of decades after he&rsquo;s arrested following some unnamed crime. A rich &ldquo;Meth&rdquo; (a pejorative term for the outrageously rich and long-lived &mdash; those who can update their consciousnesses regularly while keeping multiple copies of their bodies and thereby effectively living forever) gets Kovacs removed from storage so he can investigate the Meth&rsquo;s suicide. Kovacs then is ensnared in a world of immortal spies, robots, good and bad cops, and strange cultural mores. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the other two books in this series.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent the last few weeks in Berlin and Paris. Jo√£o, a good friend of mine from high school, lives in Berlin now and is a photographer and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerMagnetmann">Der Magnetmann</a>. Seeing Berlin through his eyes is always a joy. He&rsquo;s lived there for the last seven years and done a lot of different kinds of work (stock broker, real estate agent even) while always perfecting his photography craft. He has been selling his phenomenal photography at a large flea market called <a href="http://www.mauerpark.info/">Mauerpark</a> every Sunday. A few years back, he started putting his photos on magnets and it started taking off. He now has a space, some printers, a few employees and thousands of ideas and designs to sell his magnets wholesale. I&rsquo;ve visited him a few times since he&rsquo;s lived out there and seeing him take his photography from hobby to profession to livelihood has been inspiring.</p>

<p>This trip was great too because my girlfriend and her close friend (who is German but hadn&rsquo;t visited Berlin yet) joined a week after I was out there. We got to see a few different neighborhoods and do some really fun, interesting and fascinating walking tours of Berlin. I hadn&rsquo;t done a guided tour and I&rsquo;m completely convinced now that it&rsquo;s a perfect way to see the very basics of a new city I&rsquo;m visiting. The first tour we did was the <a href="http://berliner-unterwelten.de/home.1.1.html">Berliner Unterwelten</a> tour where we learned about the Wall and the different ways people tried to escape it through tunnels (which were dug in both directions &mdash; East to West and West to East). Hearing about the personal stories of people escaping and attempting to escape the East was incredible. Some of these tunnels were discovered as recently as ten years ago. The second tour was through <a href="http://www.newberlintours.com/daily-tours/free-tour.html">Sandeman</a>, which was a more general tour of the major sites in Mitte. Our guide Leo was fantastic and highly knowledgeable about the history of the town. Berlin, of course, was basically destroyed during World War II and it took years for it to be rebuilt (cranes after cranes are constantly seen in the city now). The tour ended with an interesting thought about Berlin always changing &mdash; that Paris will always be Paris, New York will always be New York, but Berlin will never be Berlin.</p>

<p>I also got to see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdkw_u1E2zw">Ai Weiwei</a>&rsquo;s art exhibit in Berlin. This was absolutely incredible. His art is thought-provoking and inspiring. One of his exhibits were 3,000-5,000 year old vases that he painted in metal (auto metal in some cases). Another similar exhibit exemplified the idea that people get offended when vases or old pieces of artwork are destroyed or re-imagined while there are all kinds of atrocities going on in the world today. I think this is an important point. Why should we be offended by the destruction of a 3,000 year old vase when children are being killed today in poor labor conditions or architectural endeavors? I think this kind of criticism is necessary in our world and to see it so magnificently done was encouraging.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After much prodding by those who find his writing fresh and dark, sincere and wild, I finally got around to reading China Mi√©ville. His <em>Perdido Street Station</em> read as if it were a script to a Frank Miller project like Sin City depicting the &ldquo;weird&rdquo; horror writer HP Lovecraft penning a story in the Mos Eisley Cantina about the world of Shadowrun where technology has been replaced with steampunk, magic with thaumaturgy and where insect-people fall in love with humans, while other humanoid races remake themselves into monstrous beings with tentacles and all kinds of other appendages from Asian horror-films. Though mostly dark &mdash; throughout much of the story, its characters interact with disgusting, weird and strange creatures and deal with the dredges of what humanity offers &mdash; it is absolutely new and refreshing as far as science fiction and fantasy go. Its dark realism leaves miles of room to question the motives of its characters and reflect on the ethical dilemmas that the events of the novel propose particularly towards the end. As much as I would have liked to, I couldn&rsquo;t give the work five stars on the account of its somewhat jerky plot that took a quarter of the book to get into. I also would have liked to read more about thaumaturgy, or the magic that exists in the world of Bas-Lag. Regardless, I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading more Mi√©ville.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are just my notes on Chapters 1-3 in Sandi Metz&rsquo;s <em>Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</em>. The words are mix of mine and the author‚Äôs. They are not intended for reprint elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1: Object-Oriented Design</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Changing requirements are the programming equivalent of friction and gravity. They introduce forces that apply sudden and unexpected pressures that work against the bestlaid plans. It is the need for change that makes design matter. &mdash; Sandi Metz</p></blockquote>

<p>Object-oriented design is related to parts, when combined, produce a certain behavior of the whole. <em>Objects</em> are the parts and <em>messages</em> have embodied in them their interactions. <em>Dependencies</em> occur when we want to get the correct message to the target object. The sender needs to have knowledge about the receiver. Object-oriented design is about <em>managing dependencies</em> and how objects can survive change. Part of good design is that you not only have to write code for the feature today, but one that can be changed in the future.</p>

<p>There are also <em>tools</em> for design (like SOLID, and others). Some code preparation and combination works well and some doesn&rsquo;t. Good <em>patterns</em> also exist but one should be aware of when certain patterns should be applied to certain problems. Poor design can result in software failures especially if a programmer doesn&rsquo;t understand object oriented programming. Agile development allows you to do build incrementally.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 2: Designing Classes with a Single Responsibility</strong></p>

<p>Classes. What belongs in a class? Methods are defined in classes. Classes define the &ldquo;virtual world&rdquo; that everything else flows from. Design is allowing for changeability rather than that of achieving perfection. Could should be <strong>Transparent</strong> (consequences of changing code should be obvious), <strong>Reasonable</strong> (cost of a change should be proportional to benefits), <strong>Usable</strong> (existing code should be usable in new and unexpected ways), and <strong>Exemplary</strong> (the code should inspire others who want to change it to maintain these qualities). The first step of maintaining <strong>TRUE</strong> is that each class have a single, well-defined responsibility. A class should do one small thing. A class should have a single responsibility.</p>

<p>Why does single responsibility matter? Applications that you can change with ease are made of classes that are easy to use. Reusable classes are like building blocks with few entanglements. Classes with multiple responibilities will have multiple entanglements and could cause problems.</p>

<p>How do you know if a class has a single responsibility? One way to is to interrogate the class and ask questions to it. A class is cohesive if everything in the class is dedicated towards a single responsibility. In fact, the <strong>Single Responsibility Principle</strong> is the idea that everything in a class is highly related towards the class&rsquo;s purpose.</p>

<p>Writing Code that Embraces Change. Depend on behavior, not on data. Hide instance variables, hide data structures, extract responsibilities from methods, isolate extra responsibilities in classes.</p>

<p>Methods with single responsibilities allow for the following: they expose previously hidden qualities, they avoid the need for comments, they encourage reuse and are easy to move to another class</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 3: Managing Dependencies</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Your design challenge is to manage dependencies so that each class has the fewest possible; a class should know just enough to do its job and not one thing more. &mdash; Sandi Metz</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Dependency Injection: Creates loosely coupled objects that can be reused in multiple, new ways.</li>
<li>Isolate Dependencies: Allows objects to quickly adapt to unexpected changes.</li>
<li>Remove Argument-Order Dependencies: Decreases likelihood of facing changes.</li>
<li>Managing Dependency Direction: &ldquo;The road to maintenance nirvana is paved with classes that depend on things that change less often than they do.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just started reading Sandi Metz&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a></em> as part of the prework for Launch. The introduction had a great bit about how programmers interact with their worlds (or should, rather) that I think is quite relevant to how everyone should feel about their world and how they apply meaning to their lives:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/vikram7/vikram7.github.io/blob/master/images/sandi_intro.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p>That we should have work with meaning, that it&rsquo;s our best work and that it&rsquo;s enjoyable are highly laudable goals to strive for in everything that we do. Or at least in what I do. In many ways, I feel intellectually stunted having been in finance for so long. I feel no new neurons firing off nor do I or any sense of wonder in what I do. In fact, I feel as though I&rsquo;ve become more stupid. Perhaps it was more enjoyable at one point, but that point has long passed and I don&rsquo;t see it coming back again. Moreover, my work has very little &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; and is only occasionally enjoyable. Attempting to make money for myself and for a future family, perhaps can be goals, but they just seem like ends and not something that I can derive a sense of accomplishment or meaning from. I look at my trading screens and think to myself that this can&rsquo;t possibly be what my life has become. But it has. Additionally, my disillusionment in finance has heightened. At some level, most forms of finance involve helping people who already have obscene amounts of money rake in more obscene amounts of money. Helping rich people get richer isn&rsquo;t exactly a commendable path in life.</p>

<p>I think there are a great number of <em>real</em> problems out there in the world that need to be tackled in education, or healthcare or the environment. I have no idea what specifically I want to do in these fields, but I do know that they are important and affect all of us, regardless of our stature in life. Deriving meaning from tackling these problems seems much more worthy of an endeavor than sitting around all day trying to find a new trading idea. Maybe someone out there can do both, but I haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out how.</p>

<p>So that brings me to programming and why I&rsquo;ve decided to join Launch and see where it takes me. My parents had always mentioned that <em>education</em> was the most important asset that a person can have and it&rsquo;s something that no one can take away. I don&rsquo;t think I appreciated that viewpoint in my youth as much as I do now. Even my grandfather would emphasize how important the brain is and how little we know about it. Anyways, what I am trying to say here is that one reason that I&rsquo;m looking forward to programming is that it will open up a new part of my brain, a part that I don&rsquo;t feel that have used in a long time, and that I look forward to refining. That&rsquo;s one of my biggest goals out of the program and after that, I want to start thinking about how else I can participate in an endeavor using coding to bring meaning into my life. There are a lot of interesting companies doing fascinating work in education and healthcare, and I think working on some of these problems would be provide me with a level of meaning that I don&rsquo;t really have in finance. There&rsquo;s also so much going on in robotics that could be really incredible to be part of. As of now, I&rsquo;m generally interested in the following topics and I think working on problems related to them would provide for the intellectual and emotional meaning that I&rsquo;m looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li>education, including brain enhancement</li>
<li>healthcare</li>
<li>robotics</li>
<li>environmental concerns</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are just my notes on Chapters 12 and the Conclusion of Beginning Database Design. The words are mix of mine and the author‚Äôs. They are not intended for reprint elsewhere.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Other Implementations</p>

<p><strong>Object-oriented databases</strong>:</p>

<p>Advantages exist for OO databases over relational. Complex queries might be more difficult to setup, however. For an OO database data model, we have to consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define a class for each class</li>
<li>Consider making classes for complex data types like addresses or names</li>
<li>Consider adding methods to classes (for formatting or calculations, for example)</li>
<li>Give thought to how a user will identify objects (like a primary key)</li>
<li>For the Many part of a relationship, include a collection with references to several objects</li>
<li>For the 1 part of a relationship, include a reference to a particular object</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Spreadsheets</strong>:</p>

<p>Considered to be simpler and easier than databases.
1-Many relationship:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a separate sheet for each class</li>
<li>Create a sheet where all information will be brought together</li>
<li>Use exact match lookups to display information from other sheets</li>
<li>Use data validation features for integrity between sheets</li>
</ul>


<p>Many-Many relationship:</p>

<ul>
<li>Repeated columns (good for validation and reporting, but not querying)</li>
<li>Categories as columns (good for validation, reporting, and querying)</li>
<li>Normalized ranges (good for validation and querying but poor for reporting and ease of use)</li>
</ul>


<p>Final Chapter: Conclusion</p>

<p>There are several key things to keep in mind when working through database creation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Understanding the Objective and Requirements</li>
</ol>


<p>You need to ask searching questions when it comes to what the requirements are. Most people use databases for storage but aren&rsquo;t aware of all the reasons that could arise from it. It&rsquo;s worth really delving into the requirements and possible use cases.</p>

<ol>
<li>Polishing Your Data Model</li>
</ol>


<p>Check optionality and cardinality of relationships; Check 1-many relationships with respect to whether you need to keep historical data; Check many-many relationships to see if there&rsquo;s data that depends on both classes; Some situations can be modeled with self-relationships; Check for different routes between classes. If you can get between two calsses with different routes, the routes should represent different information; Consider introducing a new class where you need to know about the combinations of objects from three or more classes simultaneously; Consider inheritance when you come across a class and think &ldquo;this class is like that one except for &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<ol>
<li>Representing Your Model in a Relational Database</li>
</ol>


<p>the RD is based on tables; every table must have a primary key; you can look at relationships between classes once your classes are represented by tables with primary keys (1-Many represented by using foreign keys; Many-Many reconstructed as two 1-Many); apply principles of normalization to check that tables are desigend in such a way that data can be entered and maintained with the greatest possible accuracy</p>

<ol>
<li>Using Your Database</li>
</ol>


<p>Figure out how people are going to use the database. How does information get pulled out? Well-designed forms and the like will help a lot here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are just my notes on Chapters 10 and 11 of Beginning Database Design. The words are mix of mine and the author‚Äôs. They are not intended for reprint elsewhere.</p>

<p>Chapter 10: Queries</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>There are a number of different relational database operations</strong>: Retrieve a subset of rows (or columns) from a table or view; use <em>join</em> to combine two tables or view; perform operations like intersect, union, difference on tables or views with the same columns</li>
<li>Indexes can speed up queries (though can slow updating data)</li>
<li>Views let you see the specs of a query to be able to reuse it</li>
</ul>


<p>Chapter 11: User Interface</p>

<ul>
<li>Well designed forms = convenience; forms and reports are usually based on views</li>
<li>If you control the permissions granted to the views, you can restrict different users to specific forms and reports</li>
<li>Subforms are a convenient way to add data involved in a 1-Many relationship</li>
<li>On forms, list boxes are a good way for users to select an allowed view; more constraints can be added with these</li>
<li>Using a different grouping will allow different reports to be constructed on a single view</li>
<li>Reports can include summary data like totals, subtotals, counts, etc.</li>
<li>Reports can be designed to further refine the subset of data each time one is run</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 8: Normalization</h2>

<p>A reminder:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each class is represented by a table</li>
<li>Each object becomes a row in a table</li>
<li>For each table, we determine a primary key, which is a field that uniquely identifies each row</li>
<li>We use the primary keyfield to represent relationships between tables by way of foreign keys</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Normalization</strong> is a way of checking fields to make sure they&rsquo;re in the right table or see if tables need to be restructured or added</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Poorly structured database tables can have some of the following problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modification problems: Repeated information might become inconsistent</li>
<li>Insertion problems: The inability to enter a record because we don&rsquo;t have information for each of the primary key fields</li>
<li>Deletion problems: Losing additional information after deleting a record to remove some information</li>
</ul>


<p>What can help with avoiding the above problems?: Functional dependencies, primary keys, and normalization</p>

<ul>
<li>A functional dependency exists between two sets of fields in a table: If field A functionally determines field B, this means that if I know the value for A, I can uniquely tell you a value for B</li>
<li>A primary key is a (minimal) set of field(s) that functionally determines all the other fields in the table</li>
<li>The first three normal forms can be summed up as: A table is based on: (1) The key; (2) The whole key; and (3) nothing but the key</li>
<li>A table in Boyce-Codd normal form is one where every determinant could be a primary key</li>
<li>Where you have three or more interrelated classes, ask questions about what information you need to know that involves all three classes and what information involves two classes independent of the third</li>
</ul>


<p>In a relational database,</p>

<ul>
<li>Create original use cases and a data model</li>
<li>Ask questions about the data model to improve understanding of the problem</li>
<li>Represent the data model with tables, primary keys and foreign keys</li>
<li>Check each table is suitably normalized</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chapter 9: More on Keys and Constaints</h2>

<p>Choosing an appropriate primary key</p>

<ul>
<li>Often, we introduce an ID number to make sure we have a stable, unique field</li>
<li>Mistakes in data entry means its possible to have a person in your database with two different ID numbers, which is not good</li>
<li>If a primary field is made up of several concatanated fields, its worth generating an ID number to reduce the size of foreign keys referencing the table</li>
<li>Unique constraints can be used to retain the uniqueness of combinations of fields that have been replaced as a primary key with a generated ID</li>
<li>Sometimes it might be useful to use a constraint on a value of field rather than have a relationship to another table</li>
<li>There are three options when it comes to row deletion that&rsquo;s being referenced by a foreign key: (1) Disaloow the deletion; (2) Make the field referencing the deleted row rowNULL (nullify delete); and (3) Remove all rows that reference the deleted row (cascade delete)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are just my notes on Chapters 6 and 7 of Beginning Database Design. The words are mix of mine and the author‚Äôs. They are not intended for reprint elsewhere.</p>

<p>Chapter 6: Generalization and Specialization</p>

<p>A couple questions to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do two classes have enough in common to reconsider how they are defined?</li>
<li>Are some of the objects in a given class different enough from other objects to warrant reconsidering how they are defined?</li>
</ul>


<p>Data model of inheritance</p>

<pre><code>    [ Super Class]
    /             \
[Sub Class A]   [Sub Class B]
</code></pre>

<p>Super Class becomes valuable when we ask questions like &ldquo;Can X be assigned to A or B?&rdquo;
Sub Classes are when we see that only some objects will have a value for an attribute but not the other one.</p>

<blockquote><p>To check whether inheritance (or sub- and superclasses) is actually applicable to
a given problem, you should ask the following questions. For example: to check whether
SubClassA is really a subclass of SuperClass in the above figure, ask</p>

<p>Is an object of SubClassA a type of SuperClass? (Always/sometimes/never)
Is an object of SuperClass a type of SubClassA? (Always/sometimes/never)</p>

<p>If the answer to the first question is ‚ÄúAlways‚Äù and the answer to the second is
‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù the problem is a good candidate for this type of model. For example,
we can check the validity of Figure 6-3 by asking
Is a data entry operator a type of employee? (Always)
Is an employee a type of data entry operator? (Sometimes)
These answers mean that making DataEntry a subclass of Employee is possible.
Asking the always/sometimes/never questions can help make sense of complicated</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>When Inheritance Is Not a Good Idea</strong>: confusing objects with subclasses, confusing an association with a subclass
<strong>When Is Inheritance Worth Considering?</strong>: the decision revolves around how important the accuracy of the data is to the objective of the project</p>

<p>When inheritance is a possibility:</p>

<ul>
<li>If different objects have mutually exclusive values for some attributes (e.g., data entry employees have speeds but technicians have grades), consider specialized subclasses.</li>
<li>When you think this is like that except for &hellip; , consider subclasses.</li>
<li>When two classes have a similar relationship with another class, consider a new generalized superclass (e.g., if both students and staff are assigned parking spaces, consider a generalized class for people).</li>
</ul>


<p>Prior to using inheritance, make sure of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have not confused objects with subclasses (e.g., Rover is probably an object, Collie could be a class).</li>
<li>An association with a category class would be sufficient (e.g., Labrador and Collie could be objects of a Breed class, and each dog could be associated with a breed).</li>
<li>It is not just the value of an attribute that is different (e.g., don‚Äôt consider inheritance because the fee for Labrador and Collie is different).</li>
</ul>


<p>Other considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classes at the top of the hierarchy should be abstract, which means they will never have any objects. This allows the problem to be more readily extended (unless you can think of a good, pragmatic reason to do otherwise).</li>
<li>Consider associations with roles when you come across the my object is a member of both these classes dilemma.</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt introduce the complexity of inheritance unless the specialized data in the subclasses is important to the main objectives of the project.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Chapter 7: From Data Model to Relational Schema</h2>

<p><img src="images/table71.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p>The steps to represent the main features of a data model with a relational database:</p>

<ol>
<li>For each class, create a table.</li>
<li>For each attribute, create a field and choose an appropriate data type. Consider whether some attributes (e.g., address) should be split into several fields.</li>
<li>Choose a field or combination of fields as the primary key. Ask careful questions to ensure that the key fields will always have unique values.</li>
<li>For each Many‚ÄìMany relationship, insert a new intermediary class and two 1‚ÄìMany relationships.</li>
<li>For each 1‚ÄìMany relationship, take the primary key field(s) from the table at the 1 end and add this field(s) as a foreign key in the table at the Many end.</li>
<li>For a 1‚Äì1 relationship, put the foreign key in the table where it is most likely to have a value.</li>
<li>For compulsory relationships, add a constraint to the foreign key fields that they must not be null.</li>
<li>For inheritance (as an approximation), use a 1‚Äì1 is a relationship between the parent and each child class.</li>
</ol>
